2. **[APFS Sparsebundle NAS Recovery & Optimization](guides/apfs-sparsebundle-nas-recovery.md)**  
   Understanding APFS band structures, fixing truncated `Info.plist`, clearing orphaned lock files, and running non-destructive `fsck_apfs` containers.

3. **[Automounting SMB Shares on macOS Using Launchd](guides/macos-automount-smb-launchd.md)**  
   Overcoming Finder login item limitations with reliable, headless LaunchAgents, sleep/wake network checks, and macOS Keychain integration.

4. **[Rclone Cloud Storage Mount with Launchd & FUSE-T](guides/rclone-launchd-macos.md)**  
   Mounting cloud drives (Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, S3) with full VFS local caching on modern Apple Silicon Macs without reducing kernel security.
